                <h1>FORESE and Mock Placements</h1><hr>
                <p>Mock Placements is the flagship event organized by FORESE. It is an annual preparatory event held exclusively for the pre-final year students from all departments of our college. The idea behind hosting Mocks is to provide an opportunity for the students to gain insight on how the actual placements will be held and experience placements first-hand.
                Each year we have an attendance of over 100â€™s HRs and other technical personnel from several companies who are invited to examine the technical strength of about 800 pre-final year students. They conduct a one-on-one interview along with one session of group discussion to gauge the skillsets of the students. MOCKS thus acts as a trial run of the actual placements which will be conducted the following year. This event has proven to enhance the proficiency of the student by creating a competitive environment and directing the student to improve their skills and make them best suited for their career.</p>

                <h1>ForEd</h1><hr>
                <p>For our students who haven't quenched their thirst for education and are looking to go abroad and pursue higher education, we organize an annual ForED fair in the odd semester to help our students explore their foreign education opportunities by talking to admission experts. One day access to various foreign education consultancy services where students can get all the information they need about higher education in various countries such as United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. This is a great chance for our students to learn how to improve their applications and get answers to all their questions in detail. Students may avail themselves of the services of various training institutes that tutor students for necessary exams like TOEFL/IELTS and learn more about the admission process. ForED helps students get a clearer picture of the requirements and demands to pursue their higher education.</p>
