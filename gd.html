    <section id="continued4">
        <ol>
            <li><span id="heading"><u><b>Rich Content with good subject knowledge :</b></u></span>
                Having good subject knowledge and rich content is the first and foremost GD tip to enter the Group Discussion Round.</li>
                
            <li><span id="heading"><u><b>Be relevant</b></u></span>
                When you speak you should speak to the point without any ambiguity of thought expresses your ideas at length. Wherever possible, emphasize your point with facts and figures.</li>
                
            <li><span id="heading"><u><b>Be a Good Listener</b></u></span>
                Learn to be a good listener. Listening Skills are Essential for the GD round, so carefully listen to what others have to say.</li>
                
            <li><span id="heading"><u><b>Body gestures: Very important tool for Group Discussion</b></u></span>
                The panelists observe the way you sit and react in the course of the discussion. Body gestures are very important because your body language says a lot about you. In a GD, sit straight, avoid leaning back onto the chair or knocking the table with a pen or your fingers. Also, do not get distracted easily. Nervous body movements, folding your hands across your chest, having skeptical expression, constantly moving, evading eye movements are the indicators of a negative personality and should be avoided at all costs.</li>
                
            <li><span id="heading"><u><b>Don't Be Aggressive:</b></u></span>
                It is expected during the Group Discussion that you are firm on your ideas and are audible enough to make an impact on the group. But being aggressive, shouting, and not allowing others in the group to speak, is not appreciated. So be careful and don’t be a bully.</li>
                
            <li><span id="heading"><u><b>Don't give up: Make multiple entries</b></u></span>
                Don’t be content with one round of one minute or half a minute speaking in the group. Focus on key points, form the ideas and opinions to enter again based on the views presented by others to further strengthen your viewpoint but at the same let others speak their time as well.</li>
                
            <li><span id="heading"><u><b>Be a leader, not a follower:</b></u></span>
                As much as it is true that GD tests your team player skills, it also tests participants' willingness to take responsibility and lead the conversation.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <span id="last_line"><p>We hope this will help you succeed and ace any GD round you will attend in your career !</p></span>
